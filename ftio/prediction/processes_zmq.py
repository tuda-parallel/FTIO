      previous prediction is still running.

    is the direct measure of whether growing rank density degrades FTIO's
    own response time, independent of prediction/processing cost downstream.

    Batching behavior is unchanged from before: each poll(1000) gives a
    straggler rank up to 1s to arrive before the batch is considered done,
    and the loop naturally bounds itself (it only keeps going while messages
    keep arriving within that window). What changed is only what gets
    measured -- recv_time now stops at the last message actually received,
    not at the final poll(1000) that times out with nothing left to receive.
    A prior version measured up to that trailing timeout, so every recv_time
    was inflated by a guaranteed ~1000ms of dead time whenever nothing more
    arrived (the common case) -- it was measuring the poll timeout, not
    receive latency.
