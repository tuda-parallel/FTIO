    Two modes are supported, selected by the ``--debounce`` flag in *args*:

    * **Default (parallel)** — the original behaviour: a new prediction
      process is spawned on every file-change event regardless of whether a
      previous prediction is still running.  Suitable when predictions are
      fast relative to the I/O period.

    * **Debounce (serial, --debounce)** — only one prediction runs at a time.
      After a prediction finishes, the monitor stamp is re-checked; if the
      file changed again during the prediction the next iteration returns
      immediately and triggers a follow-up prediction — no event is permanently
      lost.  This also eliminates concurrent writes to the unprotected Value
      fields in SharedResources (count, hits, aggregated_bytes).
