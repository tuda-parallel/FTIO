    Compute the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the signal.

    Parameters:
    - b_sampled: np.ndarray, discretized bandwidth signal.
    - fs: float, sampling frequency.
    - window: str, window function to use (default='hann').
    - nperseg: int, length of each segment (default=256).
    - noverlap: int, number of points to overlap between segments (default=None, which is nperseg // 2).
    - boundary: str, boundary padding (default=None).
    - padded: bool, whether to pad the signal (default=False).

    Returns:
    - f: np.ndarray, array of sample frequencies.
    - t: np.ndarray, array of segment times.
    - Zxx: np.ndarray, STFT of the signal.
