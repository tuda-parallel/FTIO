"""
FTIO Machine Learning module.

This module provides machine learning models for I/O bandwidth prediction:
- HybridModel: Transformer-LSTM hybrid model
- BandwidthDataset: Custom dataset for bandwidth sequences
- train_hybrid_model: Training function for the hybrid model
- predict_next_sequence: Prediction function for the hybrid model
- train_arima: Training function for ARIMA/SARIMA models
- extract: Data extraction function using FTIO frequency analysis
