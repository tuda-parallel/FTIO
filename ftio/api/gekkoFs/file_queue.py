"""
This file provides a multiprocessing-safe queue implementation for managing file paths,
ensuring that files are processed exactly once across multiple worker processes.

The FileQueue class uses shared memory data structures to enable safe concurrent access
and includes methods for adding, retrieving, and marking files as processed or failed.
